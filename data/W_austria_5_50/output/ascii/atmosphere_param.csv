# This file is generated on 12-Dec-2021 at 19:42:00 and contains for each site:
# press = air total pressure (hPa); temp = air temperature (K); vap = water vapour density (g/m^3) and hl = height level of reference amsl (km).
# All parameters are computed by: ITU-R P.835-4 model on Mean annual period.
# Atmospheric results are sorted acording to the site identification number:
#    _ 1 = Austria Graz  (Lat = 4.7070e+01 deg, Lon = 1.5440e+01 deg, Alt = 3.5300e-01 km)
# Stored values are organised as follow:
# Site number, height level of reference amsl (km), press (hPa), temp (K), vap (g/m^3)
1, 3.5300e-01, 9.7146e+02, 2.8586e+02, 6.2865e+00
